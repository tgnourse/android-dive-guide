A simple GPS utility to aid in underwater navigation. Open it up, pick a dive site and then navigate by heading and distance. Shake the app to switch waypoints. Great for the surface but attach your phone to a reel and send it to the surface to **get your location when underwater**!

## Equipment Recommendations
 * **Waterproof Case:** A clear waterproof case is essential to allowing you to take your phone on a dive. [This is an option](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BJAPMSK) that's worked well for me. Note that I had to add a little padding to keep the phone againts the clear surface. Additionally, I use zipties to ensure it really stays closed during the dive.
 * **Reel:** (Optional) A good reel will let you send the phone to the surface and get a current location if you get lost or just want to see how far you got on the dive. [This reel](https://www.leisurepro.com/p-mntrj/manta-junior-jr-reel) works well since it has an easy handle and locking mechanism, but really anything can work.
